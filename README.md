#boblight-python

This is a python client for boblightd (http://code.google.com/p/boblight/) based on the XBMC-Addon (https://github.com/bobo1on1/script.xbmc.boblight/)

#Edit
You can add custom behaviour to this client by creating a function and call it in the main loop.
The default mode is a rainbow.
